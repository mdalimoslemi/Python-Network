# Advanced Network Engineering Application

This project is an advanced network engineering application built with Flask. It includes the following features:
- TCP and UDP packet classifier
- AI for traffic analysis
- Network status online reporting

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/githubnext/workspace-blank.git
    cd workspace-blank
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

## Usage Instructions

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2. You will see the web interface with the following sections:
    - Classified Packets: Displays the captured network packets classified as TCP or UDP.
    - AI Traffic Analysis: Shows the results of the AI analysis on the captured network traffic.
    - Network Status: Displays the status of network devices and services.

3. Use the filtering options to view specific types of packets or packets from specific IP addresses.

4. Monitor the real-time updates and alerts for any issues or changes in the network status.
